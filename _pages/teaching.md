## Lecturer

**ED PSYCH 301: How People Learn**  
Spring & Fall 2025  
_UW–Madison_

<p class="note-box">
This course explores how people learn—not just cognitively, but also emotionally and socially. Learning isn’t only about what happens in the brain; it’s also shaped by our environment, routines, and relationships. One small practice we started was a

shared resource spreadsheet</a>, where students could add anything that helps them focus or feel better,including study tools, playlists, favorite campus corners, even quotes that kept them going. It’s a simple way to support and remind each other that learning is deeply human. With students’ permission, we’ll keep growing it in future semesters. You’re welcome to take a look—something in there might brighten your day too.

## Undergraduate Research Mentoring  
_Epistemic Analytics Lab, UW–Madison_

<p class="note-box"> Mentorship in our lab is all about **learning by doing and thinking together**. That’s how I’ve been mentored, and it’s how I now work with undergraduate research interns.

I enjoy working with students who are curious about education, data, and how people learn. We take on real research problems side by side, ask good questions, and learn as we go. Many of the students I’ve mentored have gone on to graduate school or data-related roles, and they’ve contributed great ideas to our projects along the way.

If you're an undergraduate at UW–Madison, check out the <a href="https://studentjobs.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">UW Student Jobs page</a> and search for <em>Epistemic Analytics</em>—we’re often hiring, and it’s a great place to learn and grow!
