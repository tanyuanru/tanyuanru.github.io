In this class, I invited students to co-create a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kuxEOxmBrjQ17s2QKsQpeB_zjSFWkTfxCUxl_NLQfwo/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank">shared resource spreadsheet</a>, including everything from study tools to playlists, quotes, and favorite campus corners that help with focus or just feeling better. It became a small way for us to support one another, and to recognize that learning is not just academic, but also emotional and human. With students’ permission, we’ll keep adding to it in future semesters. You're welcome to take a look—something in there might brighten your day too.

## Undergraduate Research Mentoring  
_Epistemic Analytics Lab, UW–Madison_

I enjoy mentoring undergraduates who are interested in applying data science, statistics, or computer science to educational contexts. Many of the students I’ve worked with have gone on to graduate programs or data-related roles. During our time together, we tackled real data problems and co-authored papers.

If you're an undergraduate at UW–Madison, check out the <a href="https://studentjobs.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">UW Student Jobs page</a> and search for <em>Epistemic Analytics</em>—we’re often hiring, and it’s a fun place to work!
