Hi!
======
I’m **Yuanru Tan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the _Learning Sciences_ program in the Department of Educational Psychology at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics](https://epistemicanalytics.org/) group, which is part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

I’m trained as a methodologist. My research focuses on **quantitative ethnography**, **learning analytics**, and **high-dimensional time series modeling and visualization** to understand learning trajectories. What excites me most about this work is **storytelling**—finding both the mathematical and visual representations of how people learn, and aligning them to tell faithful, meaningful stories of learning.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/), where I designed accessible online learning experiences under the supervision of [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I earned my Master’s degree in Education at the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana) at the [Marsal Family School of Education](https://marsal.umich.edu/), and received my Bachelor’s degree in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
