I’m **Yuanru Tan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the **Learning Sciences** program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the Center for Research on Complex Thinking.

I’m a methodologist-in-training. My work focuses on developing tools and techniques to model complex learning processes—both mathematically and visually—to tell faithful, meaningful stories of how people learn.

## Projects I’m Excited About

### **Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)**

ONA is an extension of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) that models temporal structures in discourse data. I led its development to help researchers visualize and statistically compare how ideas unfold over time. It has been applied in fields such as education and healthcare.

We wrote this paper to explain the theory and methodological design of ONA:

*International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography*, 101–116. *(Best Student Paper Award)*
</div>

<br/>

This tutorial chapter walks through how to implement ONA and ENA in R:

<!-- iPlan -->

### **iPlan**

*iPlan* is a customizable simulation for socio-environmental planning. To address the complexity of assessing user performance, we proposed a QE-based method that constructs analytic models from log data alone—enabling rich analysis even when no predefined rubrics are available.

<!-- Trajectory -->

### **Learning Trajectories**

I’m developing methods to model and visualize high-dimensional time series data to capture how learning unfolds over time. This work brings together dimensionality reduction, smoothing, and trajectory comparison techniques to identify meaningful patterns in complex learning data.  
🍥 Have interesting time series data? I’d love to collaborate—feel free to [reach out](mailto:yuanru.tan@wisc.edu)!

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) under [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I designed online learning experiences and conducted qualitative research.  

I hold an M.A. in Education from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor (advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana)) and a B.S. in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
