## About Me

I’m **Yuanru Tan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the *Learning Sciences* program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

I’m a methodologist-in-training, focused on designing tools and techniques to study learning. My work explores how to model complex learning processes—both mathematically and visually—to tell faithful, meaningful stories of how people learn.

## Projects I’m Excited About

### 📊 Ordered Network Analysis

We developed **Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)** to model, visualize, and statistically compare temporal structures in discourse. Built on Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), ONA allows researchers to capture how connections among coded elements evolve over time, and to represent those changes as dynamic network trajectories.

> *ONA is designed to bridge the gap between qualitative structure and quantitative temporal modeling.*

### 🗺️ iPlan

**iPlan** is a simulation tool for exploring socio-environmental planning. We proposed a novel QE-based method that automatically generates a learning analytic model using only system log data. This enables rich analysis of learners' problem-solving strategies—even when normative criteria or detailed qualitative codes are unavailable.

> *This project explores how data simulation and network analysis can support adaptive feedback in customizable environments.*

### ⏳ Learning Trajectories

Currently, I’m developing methods to model and visualize **high-dimensional time series data** to understand how learning unfolds over time. My goal is to preserve meaningful temporal structures while making the trajectories interpretable, both statistically and visually.

> *This work combines dimensionality reduction, smoothing, and trajectory comparison techniques to surface patterns in complex learning processes.*

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/), where I created inclusive learning designs under the supervision of [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana).

I earned my Master’s degree in Education from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana) at the [Marsal Family School of Education](https://marsal.umich.edu/), and received my Bachelor’s degree in Information Management Systems from [Tianjin University of Technology](https://www.tjut.edu.cn/) in China.
