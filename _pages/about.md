I’m **Yuanru Tan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the **Learning Sciences** program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the Center for Research on Complex Thinking.

I’m a methodologist-in-training. My work focuses on developing tools and techniques to model complex learning processes—both mathematically and visually—to tell faithful, meaningful stories of how people learn.

  margin-bottom: 2.5em;
}

.project-image {

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3><strong>Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)</strong></h3>

    ONA extends Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to model how ideas unfold over time in discourse. I led its development to help researchers visualize and compare temporal patterns in learning and communication. It has been used in education, healthcare, and other domains.

    We describe the method in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22319-1_8">this paper</a>, and walk through implementation in <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003371300-37">this tutorial</a>.

    Use ONA via <a href="https://epistemicanalytics.org/tools/">this web tool</a>.

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3><strong>iPlan</strong></h3>

    iPlan is a customizable simulation for socio-environmental planning. We designed it to assess user performance using only log data—enabling rich analysis even without predefined rubrics.

    Our approach is explained in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22319-1_20">this study</a>.

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3><strong>Learning Trajectories</strong></h3>

    I’m developing methods to model and visualize high-dimensional time series data to understand how learning unfolds. This work combines dimensionality reduction, smoothing, and trajectory comparison techniques to detect meaningful patterns in learning processes.

    Want to explore your own time series data? <a href="mailto:yuanru.tan@wisc.edu">Reach out</a>—I'd love to collaborate.

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) under [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I designed online learning experiences and conducted qualitative research.  

I hold an M.A. in Education from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor (advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana)) and a B.S. in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
