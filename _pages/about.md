I’m <span class="keyword">Yuanru Tan</span>, a Ph.D. candidate in the <span class="keyword">Learning Sciences</span> program in the Department of Educational Psychology at the [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics](https://epistemicanalytics.org/) lab, which is part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

I’m trained as a methodologist. My research focuses on <span class="keyword">quantitative ethnography</span>, <span class="keyword">learning analytics</span>, and <span class="keyword">high-dimensional time series data</span> to model and visualize learning processes. What excites me most about this work is <span class="keyword">storytelling</span>—finding both the _mathematical_ and _visual_ representations of learning phenomena, and aligning them to tell faithful, meaningful stories of how people learn.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/), where I designed accessible online learning experiences under the supervision of [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I earned my Master’s degree in Education at the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana) at the [Marsal Family School of Education](https://marsal.umich.edu/), and received my Bachelor’s degree in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
