I‚Äôm **Yuanru Tan** (‚ÄúYoo-en-roo‚Äù ‚Äî close to Mandarin pinyin *Yu«énr√∫*), a Ph.D. candidate in the Learning Sciences program at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. I‚Äôm advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://www.epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

I‚Äôm a **methodologist-in-training**. My work focuses on developing analytical tools and statistical techniques to model complex learning processes‚Äîboth mathematically and visually‚Äîto tell faithful, meaningful stories about how people learn. I follow an iterative cycle: identifying mathematical structures behind complex learning phenomena, empirically testing those structures, and ultimately designing tools and interfaces that researchers can use in their own domains.

<h2>Projects I‚Äôm Excited About</h2>

<!-- ONA -->
<div class="project-row">

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3><strong>Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)</strong></h3>

    I led the development of ONA, a network technique to model, visualize, and statistically compare temporal structures in discourse data. Built on the widely used Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), ONA has been applied in education, healthcare, and other domains.

    <h3><strong>iPlan</strong></h3>

    iPlan is a mobile simulation game where users create land-use models and explore the effects of planning decisions on environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Its open-ended design poses challenges for assessment. We developed a novel approach that builds learning analytics models directly from system log data without rubrics or hand-coded features.

    <h3><strong>Network Trajectories</strong></h3>

    I am currently developing methods to model and visualize <span class="keyword">high-dimensional time series data</span> to understand how learning unfolds over time. This work combines <span class="keyword">dimensionality reduction</span>, <span class="keyword">smoothing</span>, and <span class="keyword">trajectory comparison</span> techniques to identify meaningful patterns in complex learning data.

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) under [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). In this role, I designed online learning experiences and conducted research from a practitioner‚Äôs perspective.

One of my favorite projects with Rebecca explored how different forms of representation‚Äîboth [beaded artifacts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170427.3188650) and [digital tools](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-021-00592-x)‚Äîcan support reflection in the design process.

I hold an M.A. in Education from the University of Michigan‚ÄìAnn Arbor, where I was advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/christopher-quintana), and a B.S. in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.

This blend of design, research, and communication still shapes how I approach problems today.
