I‚Äôm **Yuanru Tan** (‚ÄúYoo-en-roo‚Äù, close to Mandarin pinyin *Yu«énr√∫*), a Ph.D. candidate in the Learning Sciences program at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. I‚Äôm advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://www.epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

I‚Äôm a **methodologist-in-training**, working at the intersection of analytics and design. My research focuses on developing analytical tools and visualization techniques to model complex learning processes‚Äîboth _mathematically_ and _visually_‚Äîand to tell faithful, meaningful stories about how people learn.

I think of my work as an iterative cycle: identifying mathematical structures underlying learning phenomena, empirically testing those structures, and ultimately designing tools and interfaces that researchers can use in their own domains. Along the way, I collaborate with and learn from talented colleagues, while contributing my own perspective to advance the field.

<h2>Projects I‚Äôm Excited About</h2>

<!-- ONA -->
<div class="project-row">

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3><strong>Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)</strong></h3>

    I led the development of ONA, a network technique to model, visualize, and statistically compare temporal structures in discourse data. Built on the widely used Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), ONA has been applied in education, healthcare, and other domains.

    <h3><strong>iPlan</strong></h3>

    iPlan is a simulation game where users design urban land-use models and explore the effects of planning decisions on environmental and social outcomes. Its open-ended structure poses unique challenges for assessment. We developed a novel approach to generate simulated learning analytics models directly from system log data, offering ‚Äúthick descriptions‚Äù for otherwise ‚Äúthin‚Äù clickstream data. We're also exploring how these models can help us better understand real learner behaviors.

    <h3><strong>Network Trajectories</strong></h3>

    I‚Äôm currently developing a method to model, visualize, and compare high-dimensional time series data to better understand how learning unfolds over time. This work explores dimensionality reduction, smoothing techniques, and trajectory comparison to uncover meaningful patterns in complex educational datasets. What excites me most is adapting and expanding time series analysis‚Äîtraditionally used in finance or sensor data‚Äîfor the unique challenges of learning analytics.

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a _Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility_ at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan‚ÄìAnn Arbor, under the mentorship of [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). It was my first full-time role after graduate school, and a place where I grew as both a designer and a researcher.

In this role, I worked with [instructors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKdWDTVEzE&t=94s&ab_channel=CenterforAcademicInnovation) who were passionate about making online learning more inclusive and accessible. I also contributed to research projects focused on understanding learning experience design. One of my favorite projects with Rebecca explored how different forms of representation‚Äîboth [beaded artifacts](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170427.3188650) and [digital visualizations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-021-00592-x)‚Äîcan shape the way designers think. (P.S. We ended up decorating our desks with those beaded artifacts, and it remains one of my favorite memories.)

I hold an M.A. in Education from the University of Michigan‚ÄìAnn Arbor advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/christopher-quintana), and a B.S. in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.

These educational and professional experiences‚Äîand the people I‚Äôve been lucky to work with‚Äîcontinue to shape how I approach problems: creatively, collaboratively, and with care.
