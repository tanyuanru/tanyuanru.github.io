## About Me

Iâ€™m **Yuanru Tan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the Learning Sciences program in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. Iâ€™m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://www.epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

Iâ€™m a <span class="keyword">methodologist-in-training</span>. My work focuses on developing analytical tools and statistical techniques to model complex learning processesâ€”both mathematically and visuallyâ€”to tell faithful, meaningful stories of how people learn.

<h2>Projects Iâ€™m Excited About</h2>

<!-- ONA -->
<div class="project-row">

  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>ðŸ“ˆ <strong>Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)</strong></h3>

    I led the development of ONA, a network technique to model, visualize, and statistically compare temporal structures in discourse data. Built on the widely used Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), ONA has been applied in education, healthcare, and other domains.

    If you're interested in ONA, we introduce the method in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-31726-2_8">this paper</a>, and walk through how to use the R package in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-54464-4_18">this tutorial</a>.

    Not an R user? You can also try ONA via the <a href="https://www.epistemicanalytics.org/our-projects/">ENA web tool</a>.

<!-- iPlan -->
<div class="project-row">
  <img src="/images/iplan-logo.png" alt="iPlan Icon" class="project-image" />
  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>ðŸŒŽ <strong>iPlan</strong></h3>

    <a href="https://www.i-plan.us/">iPlan</a> is a mobile game developed at our lab, where users create land-use models of any location in the contiguous United States and explore the effects of land-use change on environmental and socio-economic issues.

    Its highly customizable problem space poses challenges for assessing playersâ€™ performance. We proposed a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-47014-1_24">novel QE-based method</a> that automatically generates learning analytics models from system log data aloneâ€”enabling rich analysis of learnersâ€™ <span class="keyword">problem-solving strategies</span> even when no rubrics or qualitative data are available.

<!-- Learning Trajectories -->

  <img src="/images/trajectory-logo.png" alt="Trajectory Icon" class="project-image" />
  <div class="project-text">
    <h3>ðŸ§­ <strong>Network Trajectories</strong></h3>

    Iâ€™m developing methods to model and visualize <span class="keyword">high-dimensional time series data</span> to understand how learning unfolds over time. This work combines <span class="keyword">dimensionality reduction</span>, <span class="keyword">smoothing</span>, and <span class="keyword">trajectory comparison</span> techniques to identify meaningful patterns in learning processes.

    Want to explore your own time series data? <a href="mailto:yuanru.tan@wisc.edu">Reach out</a>â€”Iâ€™d love to collaborate.

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) under [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I gained valuable experience in educational research from a practitionerâ€™s perspective.

One of my favorite projects with Rebecca explored how we used both [beaded representations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3170427.3188650) and [digital representations](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11528-021-00592-x) to support reflection on learning design.

I hold an M.A. in Education from the University of Michiganâ€“Ann Arbor, where I was advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/christopher-quintana), and a B.S. in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
