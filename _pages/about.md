I’m **Yuanru Tan**, a Ph.D. candidate in the **Learning Sciences** program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics Lab](https://epistemicanalytics.org/), part of the Center for Research on Complex Thinking.

I’m a methodologist-in-training. My work focuses on developing tools and techniques to model complex learning processes—both mathematically and visually—to tell faithful, meaningful stories of how people learn.

  <div class="project-text">

> ### **Ordered Network Analysis (ONA)**
> I led the development of ONA, an extension of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) that allows users to model, visualize, and statistically compare temporal structures in discourse data.  
> 📄 *“Ordered Network Analysis.”* Tan, Y., Ruis, A. R., Marquart, C., Cai, Z., Knowles, M. A., & Shaffer, D. W. (2022). *International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography*, 101–116. *(Best Student Paper Award)*  
> 📘 *“Tutorial chapter on ENA and ONA in R.”* Tan, Y., Swiecki, Z., Ruis, A. R., & Shaffer, D. (2024). In *Learning Analytics Methods and Tutorials: A Practical Guide Using R*, 569–636.  
> Try the [ONA web tool](https://epistemicanalytics.org/tools/) or build your own model in R with our tutorial.

  </div>
  <div class="project-text">

> ### **iPlan**
> *iPlan* is a customizable simulation for socio-environmental planning. To address the complexity of assessing user performance, we proposed a QE-based method that constructs analytic models from log data alone—enabling rich analysis even when no predefined rubrics are available.  
> 📄 Ruis, A. R., Tan, Y., et al. (2023). *“Thin data, thick description.”* *International Conference on Quantitative Ethnography*, 349–364.

  </div>
  <div class="project-text">

> ### **Learning Trajectories**
> I’m developing methods to model and visualize high-dimensional time series data to capture how learning unfolds over time. This work brings together dimensionality reduction, smoothing, and trajectory comparison techniques to identify meaningful patterns in complex learning data.  
> 🍥 Have interesting time series data? I’d love to collaborate—feel free to [reach out](mailto:yuanru.tan@wisc.edu)!

## Before the Ph.D.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/) under [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I designed online learning experiences and conducted qualitative research.  

I hold an M.A. in Education from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor (advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana)) and a B.S. in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
