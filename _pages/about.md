I’m <span class="keyword">**Yuanru Tan**</span>, a Ph.D. candidate in the <span class="keyword">**Learning Sciences**</span> program in the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I’m advised by [Professor David Williamson Shaffer](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/fac-staff/williamson-shaffer-david/) in the [Epistemic Analytics](https://epistemicanalytics.org/) lab, part of the [Center for Research on Complex Thinking](https://www.crct.center/).

I’m trained as a methodologist. I design methods and build tools to support educational research. In recent years, I’ve led the development of methods like <span class="keyword">Ordered Network Analysis</span>, which have been adopted in studies across Quantitative Ethnography, Learning Analytics, and Educational Data Mining. Currently, I’m developing a method for modeling and visualizing <span class="keyword">high-dimensional time series data</span> to understand learning trajectories.

What excites me most in my work is <span class="keyword">storytelling</span>: finding both _mathematical_ and _visual_ representations of how people learn, and aligning them to tell faithful, meaningful stories of learning.

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Learning Experience Designer for Accessibility at the [Center for Academic Innovation](https://ai.umich.edu/), where I designed accessible online learning experiences under the supervision of [Professor Rebecca Quintana](https://marsal.umich.edu/directory/faculty-staff/rebecca-quintana). I earned my Master’s degree in Education from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor, advised by [Professor Chris Quintana](https://soe.umich.edu/directory/christopher-quintana) at the [Marsal Family School of Education](https://marsal.umich.edu/), and received my Bachelor’s degree in Information Management Systems from Tianjin University of Technology in China.
